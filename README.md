# verysimple_discord_rollbot
type roll (dice(s)) and then bot will roll

Made to try out how bots work on discord and/or in general idk.

Should be able to plop in the token for your discord bot you can run it. Needs permission to read and write messages.

There are probably some gimmicks with the rolling part so be accurate with "roll " since i u just set the limit to 5 characters.
